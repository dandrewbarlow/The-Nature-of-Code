# The Evolution of Code

## Evolutionary Computing

- Traditional Genetic Algorithm
- Interactive Selection
- Ecosystem Simulation

## Why / How?

- The Random Monkey => Shakespeare Theory is an example of a Genetic Algorithm
- probability of typing the letter `t` randomly: 1/27
- probability of typing the letters `to` randomly: 1/27 \* 1/27
- probability of typing `to be or not to be that is the question` randomly: (1/27) ^ 39
  - a computer simulation w/ 1 million phrases per second would take longer than the age of the universe

## Darwinian Natural Selection

- Heredity - there must be a process in place by which children receive the properties of their parents
- Variation - there must be a variety of traits present in the population or a means with which to introduce variation
- Selection - there must be a mechanism by which some members of a population have the opportunity to be parents and pass down their genetic information and some do not. AKA "survival of the fittest"
