# Vectors
I'm personally already familiar with vectors, so I'm going to be pretty fast and loose here, but as always the coding excersizes will be fun nonetheless, plus it covers the p5 vector class.

## What is a Vector?

That's it. That's a vector.

## Vector Math
### p5 Vector Methods
There are a lot at the [p5.js reference page for vectors](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Vector)
